# US Traffic Accident Data Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on US traffic accident data. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The notebook also includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: `US Traffic Accident Data`. It includes various features related to traffic accidents, such as road conditions, weather conditions, and timestamps.

## Repository Structure
`EDA_On_US_Traffic_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis. This notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, and visualization to identify patterns and insights related to traffic accidents.
## Analysis
The Jupyter notebook includes the following analyses:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Analysis of road conditions and their impact on accidents
- Exploration of weather conditions and their correlation with accidents
- Time-based analysis to identify patterns related to the time of day
- Visualization of accident hotspots using geographical data
